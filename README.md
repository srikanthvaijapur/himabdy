### Wish someone special happy birthday in a special way.

On the birthday of a special friend, I felt like the generic happy birthday text just wasn't gonna cut it for me. So I put together this animated web page to makae them feel special.

I decided to publish it so that you can use it to make the special people in your life feel a bit more of what they truly are: special.
You can create your very own happy-birthday page in a few easy steps:

I have deployed it in netlify,u can use gitpages to deploy

I've used plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for animations.
If you have any idea to improve it or make it more interesting, feel free to send a PR, or create an issue for a feature request.

Happy wishing! ðŸŽ‰
